= Build instructions =

This program should make on any system that conforms to POSIX.1-2001 and C99.

Accordingly, the horrible old autoconf build has been shot and buried.
So have the (probably bitrotted) build instructions for Windows.

On Unix systems,

	make

You may get messages about missing libpng or libz. The former is the
PNG reference library, the latter the implementation of the compression
algorithm it uses; install them and retry.

On systems that don't have libm, simply commenting out the -lm ought to work.

Then (as root) install with:

	make install

You can uninstall with

	make uninstall

You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
source code directory by typing `make clean'.
